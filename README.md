## Testing advantages

jasmine is a framework to test javascript code. When you write tests before even writing the application, they give an introductory idea how to implement the functionalities you need. Once you write a test and actually write the code that pass this test and move on to the next one, you actually build your project step-by-step. This is important to diagnose the code more easily if something went down as we can know which test exactly fails.
